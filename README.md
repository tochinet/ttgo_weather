This is actually a fork of [VolosR](https://github.com/VolosR/)'s [TTGO Weather Station](https://github.com/VolosR/TTGOWeatherStation), but
[nilili](https://github.com/nilili/) added a few interesting features :

- 

I (Tochinet) merged from my own fork of OWM_
Makes use of TFT_eSPI library, not Adafruit.
Reads weather info from OpenWeatherMap like own 
Arduino .ino file, no python

To Add from OWM skech :
- webserver on 192.168.1.2 (same MAC ?)
- publish to ThingSpeak
- publish to GroveStream
- add secrets.h file for credentials ?
